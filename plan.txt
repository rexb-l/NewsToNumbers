Things to do in order of priority:
1. find out how sentiment analysis works in practice (BERT)
2. reasearch some APIS for stock
3. figure out webscraping headlines

In essence, how my program will work:
obtain headlines
give headlines to sentiment analysis program
obtain a sentiment
track short term movements in stock
see if there is any statistical correlation between these two
plot potential correlation or lack thereof
